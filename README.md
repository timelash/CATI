# CATI - Classify And Tag Images

A personal project on AI learning to detect what images are - and later to tag them via changes to EXIFdata

Starting point: https://github.com/techwithtim/5-Python-AI-Projects/blob/main/project2.py

Decided to clone rather than branch as I do want to add to it and change it to fit my personal needs.

Requirements:
tensorflow
maytplotlib

## Install via pip:

```bash
  pip3 install tensorflow
  pip3 install matplotlib
```

Note: tensorflow was a bit of a pain to get working. I initally wanted to run this script in a Linux Mint VM,
but as the VM did not a GPU, I then went down the path of running thew script on a W11 machine in a virtual environment that did have a GPU.

FYI, I used Python 3.9 with tensorflow 1.5.

For a [compatibilty list](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) (with alternate versions of tf)
